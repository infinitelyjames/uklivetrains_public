# uklivetrains

A basic android app in flutter for viewing the live trains on a station on the UK rail network.

This project is paired with another repository, which is an REST API wrapper for rail APIs. You'll need this as well to get this app working - make sure to copy your api key for the wrapper into `lib/modules/api.dart`
